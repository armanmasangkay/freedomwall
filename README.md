Create a simple website where someone can post their thoughts about a certain organization.


The site should have an admin page where they can create organizations to which the users can add comments into.
The user can register on the site's landing page.


These are just some of the things that I think would be important as of now. Please let me know what do you think about it. Cheers

<b>Instructions:</b>

Make a new <strong>LARAVEL</strong> installation in your local machine since <code>/vendor</code> are not included. Right after, just overwrite it with the files we have here.
edit <code>.env</code> depending on your server's configuration.
